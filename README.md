# DecisionMaker

**The goal:** To run out of energy from doing the work we need to do, or rest we need to capitalize on, one thing at a time.

There is the idea of Multitasking, doing many things at once, but the brain doesn’t work like that, and constantly switching between things you need to do or want to do all at once will just tire you out and leave you with nothing finished, and you won't have the energy to finish it. This Decision maker makes it easier to decide what to do next if you can’t, through a simple system.

It asks what you would like to work on, what you like to do for fun, and what you like to do when you are tired and need rest, and makes a decision bsed off of that


Rules:
You must answer earnestly
You can only have one answer for each question
Each answer must be strict and cannot be left for interpretation
Once you get your answer, no buts, just do it
